# News Aggregator App

Staying informed is important. And finding unbiased sources is close to impossible. So I figure the next best thing to impartiality is equality.

This news aggregator is simple: you provide a topic and the site returns the most relevant results from just about any source you can imagine!

I encourage you to open an issue if you encounter a bug or if you'd like to see a feature added.

## Usage
